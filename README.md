# BingeCult
BingeCult is a social watch-tracking app built with the MERN stack that lets users join groups, create shared watchlists, and track their progress on movies and series — all while avoiding spoilers and sharing reactions.  It’s not a streaming app — it’s a cult for binge-watchers who love watching together, reacting together, and staying in sync.
